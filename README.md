A repository containing Python reimplementations of: 

* PG<sub>1</sub>-bias model (see *Piech, C., Huang, J., Chen, Z., Do, C., Ng, A., & Koller, D. (2013). Tuned models of peer assessment in MOOCs. arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.2579.*)
* PAAS model (see *Gutierrez, P., Osman, N., Roig, C., & Sierra, C. (2016, May). Personalised Automated Assessments. In Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems (pp. 1115-1123).*)

and the original source code for the PG-bivariate model.
